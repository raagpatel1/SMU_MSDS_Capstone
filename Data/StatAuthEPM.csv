The package BayesCTDesign, which is available on CRAN, has two simulation functions, historic_sim() and simple_sim() for studying trial characteristics under user defined scenarios, and two methods print() and plot() for disp",2022,1,5,J Stat Softw,Journal of statistical software,Bayesian statistics; R; clinical trials; historical controls; power prior,Eggleston,Barry S,RTI International,NA,M
